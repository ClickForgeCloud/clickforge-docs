# Saved Configurations

Saved configurations store Index Analysis setups so you can re-run the same experiment later.

## Where to find them

In **Index Analysis**, use the **Saved Configurations** section to load, save, or delete configurations for the active organization.

## Naming rules

Configuration names must match:

`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,127}$`

That means:

- Start with a letter or number
- Use only letters, numbers, `_`, or `-`
- Maximum length is 128 characters
