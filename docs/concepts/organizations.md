# Organizations

Organizations are the top-level scope in ClickForge. Everything you see or save is tied to the active organization.

## What organizations control

- Which endpoints you can access
- Which saved Index Analysis configurations appear in the UI
- The default organization when you sign in

## Switching organizations

Use the Org selector at the top of the sidebar to switch context. When you switch, endpoints and saved configs update immediately.
